          Hi! I’m <strong>Mudasir Abbas</strong>, a <strong>BS Artificial Intelligence</strong> student at the
          <strong>University of Lahore</strong>, passionate about technology, coding, and innovation. I’m currently
          enhancing my programming skills in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C/C++</strong>, with a strong focus on
          solving real-world problems through intelligent systems.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-5">
          I’m also working with <strong>The Software Insight</strong>, where I continue to grow my expertise in software
          development and learn how to turn ideas into impactful digital solutions.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-5">
          <strong>The Insight Hub</strong> — this blog website — is a project I built with guidance from my instructor
          <strong>Dr. Angela Yu</strong>. It represents my journey as a learner and developer, combining everything I’ve
          learned so far about web development, design, and backend logic.
        </p>
